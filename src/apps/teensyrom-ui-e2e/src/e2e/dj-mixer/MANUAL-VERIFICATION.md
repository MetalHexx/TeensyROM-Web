# Manual browser verification — the DJ view's SID panel vs `ASID-DJ-ROOT-WIREFRAME-SID-PANEL.html`

The SID panel (`lib-dj-sid-panel`) replaces the old mixer card in the DJ view. It is a 620px column
(`--mixer-col: 38.75rem`) between the two decks' Voice/Speed columns, and it is laid out for a
**1920 × 1080** viewport at minimum. The automated proof is in `dj-mixer-controls.cy.ts` and
`dj-mixer-responsive.cy.ts` (outside CI; run against a live dev server). This file records the
checks that need a real browser. The "Byte fidelity", "Hardware acceptance", "Permission
auto-connect" and "Filter sweep listening session" sections below are separate records and are
unchanged.

## How this was driven

`pnpm start` at `http://localhost:4200/dj-mixer` in a real Chrome tab. The automation window's
viewport cannot be set to a target CSS size, so the app was loaded into a same-origin `<iframe>` of
**1920 × 1080** CSS px, whose own `innerWidth`/`innerHeight` are that size, so the real media queries
and the live cascade apply. Every number below is `getBoundingClientRect()` or `scrollWidth` on the
live DOM. The cards' entry animation is a `scale(0.8)` transform that skews a rect read mid-flight,
so a stylesheet pinning `lib-scaling-container { transform: none }` was injected before measuring.
No API (port 10213) was running and no device was attached, so the page showed no devices.

## The panel at 1920 × 1080, bindings panel closed and open

| element | closed | open |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib-dj-sid-panel` (x, y, w × h) | 698, 66, 620 × 661.6 | 512, 66, 620 × 661.6 |
| `lib-synth-panel` faceplate (w × h) | 596 × 637.6 | — |
| each `lib-sid-voice-strip` (client / scroll width) | 90 / 90 | 90 / 90 |
| `.bottom-band` | 112, 739.6, 1792 × 324.4 | — |
| `lib-dj-bindings-panel` | — | 1544, 66, 360 × 998 |
| `.router-content` scroll / client height | 1030 / 1030 | 1030 / 1030 |

- Both decks' three voice strips, filter and Key sections, Panic buttons and deck labels render as
  frames A and B of the wireframe draw them: Deck A's lower row reads Filter then Key and deck B's
  Key then Filter, the bindings icon sits between the two labels, and the Camelot | Note switch
  sits between the two Panic buttons (136 × 24 at 940, 683; Panic A ends at 862 and Panic B starts at
  1154, either side of it).
- No voice strip overflows horizontally (client width equals scroll width on all six), and the panel
  keeps its 620px with the bindings panel open: the decks give way, not the panel.
- The page does not scroll (document 1080 = 1080) and the listing keeps a 324px band.
- Closing the bindings panel from its own close button returns focus to the bindings button.
- Camelot is no longer truncated: the switch is 8.5rem wide, and each cell's text fits (client 67 =
  scroll 67).
- **Not run: the live rings and lights.** No device or tune was reachable, so the rings following a
  playing tune, holding on pause, and the ghost on a locked waveform were not checked in the DJ view.
  Only the still states are verified. The painter's own unit tests cover the register-to-indicator
  mapping.

## The POC page still runs

`http://localhost:4200/dev/dj-poc`: loaded the bundled "InSID3 Out — Divertigo" tune on deck A, which
plays (frames advance and the status reads Playing). Moving the channel fader, crossfader, cutoff,
resonance, pulse-width and Key controls changes their values (Key's readout changed from `5A` to
`11A`), playback continues, and the console shows no errors — only the expected "no MIDI port
selected" warnings. The library refactor and the knob extension left the POC's behaviour alone.

## Byte fidelity (P03-T02)

Not run. This task (`P03-T02`, wiring the drag/drop-to-alert path) requires a real TeensyROM
cartridge attached over serial to retrieve an actual `.sid` file's bytes and produce a real
SHA-256 in the alert. No cartridge was attached in this execution environment, so the drop →
retrieve → alert path, the byte count, and the hash were never exercised end to end here — this
check, and the companion real-browser check for the drag chip showing the correct row's name
(called out in the task as not skippable), are left for an operator with a device attached. No
hash is recorded here; none was fabricated.

To perform this check once a cartridge is available: `pnpm nx serve teensyrom-ui`, drag a known
`.sid` file from the DJ mixer's listing onto a deck's transport, copy the hash out of the resulting
alert, then hash the same file on the desktop (`Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 <file>` on Windows,
or `sha256sum <file>` on macOS/Linux) and confirm the two hex strings match.

## Hardware acceptance (P04-T02)

Not run. This task wires the DJ Mixer's deck columns to `DeckService`/`DjStore` — the load,
transport, and MIDI binding path — which the automated Cypress specs exercise against fixture
devices only (`dj-mixer-decks.cy.ts`, `dj-mixer-responsive.cy.ts`). The checklist below requires a
real TeensyROM cartridge connected over serial and was not exercised end to end in this execution
environment; no result is recorded here, only what an operator with a device attached still needs
to confirm, per the task's own acceptance criteria:

- `pnpm nx serve teensyrom-ui`, connect a device, and drag a `.sid` file from the listing onto
  deck A: the transport's status LED shows **Analyzing…** and then **Playing** — or, on a failed
  read, **failed** with a reason on the LED and no DJ-raised alert (a device-read failure still
  carries the `-3` file service's own alert; that alert is expected and accepted, not a DJ Mixer
  regression).
- Dragging the same file onto deck A again shows no new network request in DevTools' Network tab
  and goes straight to **Playing**, skipping both the Loading and Analyzing phases — the tune is
  already resolved from the prior drop, so nothing new is fetched or scanned.
- After a page refresh, deck A's Output port select comes back either bound to its prior selection
  or showing the "last saw" placeholder for a port not currently present — never reset to the
  unbound placeholder while a binding is on record.
- With deck A already bound to a MIDI output port, that same port appears disabled and marked
  "taken by Deck A" in deck B's own binding card select.

## Permission auto-connect on reload (P05-T04)

Not run. This task makes `DeckBindings.hydrate` query the origin's standing Web MIDI permission
and request access on its own when already granted, so a reload comes up bound with no click, and
hides each deck's Enable MIDI button while access is granted. Cypress cannot carry a real,
persisted Web MIDI permission grant across a page reload (`dj-mixer-decks.cy.ts` runs with no
grant, by design, and asserts the button is present in that state), so the granted-origin path
needs a real browser to confirm:

- `pnpm nx serve teensyrom-ui`, open `/dj-mixer`, click a deck's Enable MIDI button and grant the
  browser's SysEx permission prompt. Both decks' Enable MIDI buttons disappear once granted.
- Reload the page. Both decks come up with their prior selection bound (or the "last saw"
  placeholder for a port not currently present) with no click — Enable MIDI stays hidden on the
  granted origin.
- In the browser's site settings, revoke the MIDI permission for the origin, then reload. Enable
  MIDI is showing again on both decks, and no alert was raised for a merely-not-yet-granted
  origin.

## Filter sweep listening session (operator, real hardware)

Run these four checks on your C64s with a real TeensyROM. Nothing here was run in the sandbox,
because sound is judged on hardware.

1. On a tune that never uses the filter, turning cutoff audibly changes the sound, and centre plays
   the tune exactly as before. On a tune that uses the filter, its own filtering returns the moment
   the knob is back at centre.
2. Resonance is audible while sweeping, on any tune.
3. Give a verdict on the sweep's feel, including whether passing through centre sounds smooth and
   whether anything needs retuning.
4. Turn the knob out of centre, back into it, and across from one side to the other. Each time the
   filter switches, the deck's volume fades out to silence, the switches change on a silent frame,
   and the volume fades back in (`FILTER_SWEEP.dip` sets the number of frames each way). Say
   whether the click is still audible, a gap is audible, or nothing is. If the click is still
   there, lengthen the fades; if a gap is audible, shorten them.

The verdict is recorded in the ASID-DJ portfolio's Decisions. The values to retune live in
`FILTER_SWEEP` and `RESONANCE_SWEEP` in `libs/application/src/lib/dj/mixer/filter-sweep.ts`. The
sweep is tuned for a 6581 (`FILTER_SWEEP.chip`) until a settings page lets the user pick their chip.
